	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I participated in quite a few competitions, both divisional and school-wide, even regionals! I once participated in a web design context for the 2017 Marikina Division Technolympics, where I placed second and won a silver medal. But I can't think of anything that happened after that that may have been extracurricular for this class. Well, it's been a very long time.

	<blockquote>
	<p style="font-family: Trebuchet MS; font-size: 1.8em;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In recent years, I have participated in a variety of sports. I engaged in taekwondo, volleyball, and badminton. I even took part in two competitions! In taekwondo, I still recall taking home a bronze medal. I stopped participating in sports after that. Instead, I joined a number of organizations, including the Boy Scouts of our school and the Red Cross Youth Marikina Chapter. I also read books on my free time. My favourite author is Madelline Miller. I always get ecstatic when I am reminded of her writing style which is a classic.

			<p style="margin: -5em 1.5em 0 0;">I could not boast much about my skills since I have only a few that includes: writing. However, there is a condition. Writing, without pressure. I love writing, but not so much when I am forced to puke words in a limited amount of time. I like to keep my words pouring swiftly. Calm and calculated. I was inclined on writing poems when I was younger. But as I grew up, so did the volume of the words I wanted to speak. So I started writing prose.</p>
